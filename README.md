A fork of the [DIY GeigerKit](https://sites.google.com/site/diygeigercounter/home) firmware for experimentation and extension of functionality.

I've built this successfully with Arduino 1.8.9 on Windows.

Ensure the libraries in `libraries_GK-B5` are in your Arduino libraries directory prior to building.

If you have problems with Arduino's GCC throwing a seg fault and failing compilation, [see this thread for a workaround](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/issues/7949#issuecomment-492685178).
